=> 316 inconsistent references for links found in 174 specifications

Links in the body of a specification should be to the same document as that pointed to by the related reference in the References section. The specifications reported here use a different URL. For instance, they may use a link to the Editor's Draft but target the latest published version in the References section. There should be some consistency across the specification.
